Advent of Code is an annual series of programming challenges created by Eric Wastl. It consists of daily puzzles released during December, each with two parts that progressively increase in complexity. These challenges are a great way to practice programming, improve problem-solving skills, and have fun solving puzzles in your favorite programming language.

I have decided to use JavaScript because of its flexibility and the ability to solve challenges on any computer.
